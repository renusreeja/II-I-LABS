# Experiment 16
## Aim : Write a C++ program to add and subtract two complex numbers by overloading the + and â€“ operators
### Step by Step procedure for the experiment
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream).

Step 2 - Create a class (Complex) with real and img as class members, display() as member function.

Step 3 - Create a default constructor and then initialize the values of real and img using this pointer.

Step 4 - Define the operator functions as Complex operator +() and Complex operator -() inside the class.

Step 5 - Write respective code for member function display().

Step 6 - Create a main method().

Step 7 - Create objects for class Complex inside the main method.

Step 8 - Call the operator functions.

Step 9 - Call the member function display.

Step 10 - return 0 to exit form the program execution.
