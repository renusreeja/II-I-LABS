# Experiment 10 
## Aim of Experiment
#### Write a C++ program to allocate memory using new operator.
### Step by Step Procedure of the Experiment
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream and stdio.h)

Step 2 - Create a pointer variable(ptr) inside the main method

Step 3 - Allocate memory to pointer variable using new operator.

Step 4 - Initialize 'ptr' to 100.

Step 5 - Print the Number of bytes of pointer variable and value of pointer variable.
