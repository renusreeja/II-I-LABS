# Experiment 9
## Aim : Write a C++ program to demonstrate Constructors & Destructors
Step by Step Procedure of the experiment
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream and string.h).

Step 2 - Declared within a person class private int age and string name constructor and a print function.

Step 3 - Initialize a variable ‘age’ to 0 and 'name' to none within the constructor.

Step 4 - Implicitely call parameterized constructor and a copy constructor.

Step 5 - Display ‘age’ value and 'name' with the help of print function.

Step 6 - Declare a destructor function within a person class.

Step 7 - Within the main function create a instances of the person class to ‘p0’ , 'p1' , 'p2'.

Step 8 - Call a method of print function using ‘p0’ , 'p1' and 'p2' with their respective syntax.

Step 9 - return 0 to exit from the program execution.
