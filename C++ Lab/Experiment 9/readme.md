# Experiment 9
## Aim : Write a C++ program to demonstrate Constructors & Destructors
Step by Step Procedure of the experiment
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream and string.h).

Step 2 - Create a class (Numbers) with x, y as data members and display() as member function.

Step 3 - Initialize variables ‘x’ and 'y' using parameterized constructor.

Step 4 - Declare a destructor within the class.

Step 5 - Define the function display() outside the class using scope resolution operator.

Step 6 - In the main() function, call the constructor and display() function.

Step 7 - return 0 to exit from the program execution.
