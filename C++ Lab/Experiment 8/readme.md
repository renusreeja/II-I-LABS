# Experiment 8
## Aim : Write a C++ program on Friend Class &Friend Function
### Step by Step procedure for the experiment
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream and string.h)

Step 2 - Create a class name 'B' for forward declaration.

Step 3 - Create a class name 'A' with the following class members. 'x' as a private data member setdata() and max() as public member functions.

Step 4 - Use the keyword friend before max() member function to declare a friend function with the parmeters of class names 'A' and 'B'.

Step 5 - Create a class name 'B' with the following class members. 'y' as a private data member setdata() and max() as public member functions.

Step 6 - Declare the friend function max() in class B.

Step 7 - Outside the class use the max() function to define the friend class(to find max of given two numbers) and objects as parameters.

Step 8 - Create a main() method.

Step 9 - Create the objects(a,b) of the above class A and class B respectively inside the main() method.

Step 10 - Make function calls setdata() using class object.

Step 11 - Finally call friend function (max) with object names as parameters.
