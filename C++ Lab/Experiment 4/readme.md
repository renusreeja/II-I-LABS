# Experiment 4
## Aim : Write a C++ program to declare Struct. Initialize and display contents of member Variables
### Step by Step Procedure
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream and string.h).

Step 2 - Create a structure (Person) with the following member variables. name,age as data members.

Step 3 - Create a main() method.

Step 4 - Create a variable of the above structure inside the main() method.

Step 5 - Then, read data into member variables of that structure using structure variable with dot operator.

Step 6 - Finally, display data of member variables of that structure using structure variable with dot operator.
