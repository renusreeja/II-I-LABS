# Experiment 7
## Aim : Write a C++ program using this pointer.
### Step by Step procedure for the experiment
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream)

Step 2 - Create a class (Employee) with the following class members as public members. name,id and salary as data members. display() as member function

Step 3 - Call a parameterised constructor with local variable is same as a member's name.

Step 4 - Inside the parameterised constructor the 'this' pointer is used to retrieve the object's hidden by the local variables 'name','id','salary'.

Step 5 - Implement the member functions with the respective code.

Step 6 - Create a main() method.

Step 7 - Creating two objects of Employee e1 and e2 along with parameters.

Step 8 - Call the member function display().

Step 9 - return 0 to exit from the program execution.
