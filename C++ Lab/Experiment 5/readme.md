# Experiment 5
## Aim : Write a C++ program to declare a class. Declare pointer to class. Initialize and display the contents of the class member
### Step by Step procedure
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream).

Step 2 - Create a class (employe) with the following members as public members. name,id,salary as data members. read() and display() as member functions.

Step 3 - Create a main() method.

Step 4 - Create a variable (emp) and a pointer variable (ptr) of the above class inside the main() method.

Step 5 - Assign the address of class object (emp) to class pointer object (ptr).

Step 6 - Then, call the member function display() using class pointer object (ptr) to illustrate member functions access using class pointer.

Step 7 - Assign values to data members of the class using class pointer object to illustrate data members access using class pointer.

Step 8 - Finally, call the member function and display() using class pointer object (ptr)
