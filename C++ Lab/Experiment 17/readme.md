# Experiment 17
## Aim : Write a C++ Program to use the stringstream class to count the number of words in a string.
### Step by Step procedure for the experiment
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream).

Step 5 - Create a main method().

Step 6 - Declare a string str and initialise it with a value.

Step 7 - Store it in the stringstream using an object.

Step 5 - Declare another string word.

Step 6 - Declare an integer count and initialise the value with 0.

Step 7 - Until we reach the end of the string, increment the count after accessing each word.

Step 8 - Print the value of number of words in given string using count variable.

Step 9 - return 0 to exit form the program execution.
