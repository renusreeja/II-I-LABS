# Experiment 12(a)
## Aim : Write a C++ Program to illustrate early binding.

Step 1: Include the required header files (iostream).

Step 2: Create a class (overload) and define multiple methods with the same name add() but with the different data type and functionality same.

Step 3: Define the functionality in member function.

Step 4: Create a main() method.

Step 5: Creating object of overload as obj

Step 6: Call the member function add() with respective parameters.
