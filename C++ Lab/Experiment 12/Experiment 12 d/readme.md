# Experiment 12(d)
## Aim : Write a C++ Program on Abstract classes.
### Step by Step Procedure for the Experiment
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream and string.h).

Step 2 - Create a base class (Base) with the following class members as public members. a as data members. display() as member function.

Step 3- Create a pure virtual function in a base class with syntax virtual returntype functionname()=0.

Step 4 - Create a Derived class (Derived) with the following class members as public members. b as data members. display() as member function.

Step 5 - Implement the member functions with the respective code.

Step 6 - Create a main() method.

Step 7 - Assign the address of class object (Base) to class pointer object (ptr).

Step 8 - Creating an object of Derived as obj.

Step 9 - Then, call the member functions read() and display() using class pointer object (ptr) to illustrate member functions access using class pointer.

Step 10 - Assign values to data members of the class using class pointer object to illustrate data members access using class pointer.

Step 11 - Finally, call the member functions initialize() and display() using class pointer object (ptr).

Step 12 - return 0 to exit form the program execution.
