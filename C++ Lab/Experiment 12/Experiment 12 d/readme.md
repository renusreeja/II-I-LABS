# Experiment 12(d)
## Aim : Write a C++ Program on Abstract classes.
### Step by Step Procedure for the Experiment
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream and string.h).

Step 2 - Create a base class (Base) with the following: x as data member, getX() as member function.

Step 3- Create a pure virtual function in a base class with syntax virtual returntype fun()=0.

Step 4 - Create a Derived class (Derived) with the following: y as data member, fun() as member function.

Step 5 - Implement the member functions with the respective code.

Step 6 - Create a main() method.

Step 7 - Creating an object of Derived as d.

Step 8 - Finally, call the member function fun() using derived class object.

Step 9 - return 0 to exit form the program execution.
