# Experiment 12(c)
## Aim : Write a C++ Program to illustrate concept of Virtual Functions.
### Step by Step Procedure for the Experiment
Step 1: Include the required header files (iostream).

Step 2: Declare the base class A with data member x.

Step 3: Declare and define the virtual function display().

Step 5: Create the derived class B from the base class.

Step 6: Declare and define the functions display().

Step 7: In the main function, Create the base class pointer variable.

Step 8: Create the derived class object and call the function display() using the derived class object and pointer.

Step 9: return 0 and exit the program.
