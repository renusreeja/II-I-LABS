# Experiment 12(c)
## Aim : Write a C++ Program to illustrate concept of Virtual Functions.
### Step by Step Procedure for the Experiment
Step 1: Include the required header files (iostream).

Step 2: Declare the base class base.

Step 3: Declare and define the virtual function show().

Step 4: Declare and define the function display().

Step 5: Create the derived class from the base class.

Step 6: Declare and define the functions display() and show().

Step 7: Create the base class object and pointer variable.

Step 8: Call the functions display() and show() using the base class object and pointer.

Step 9: Create the derived class object and call the functions display() and show() using the derived class object and pointer.

Step 10: return 0 and exit the program.
