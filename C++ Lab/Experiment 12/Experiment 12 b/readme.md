# Experiment 12(b)
## Aim : Write a C++ Program to illustrate late binding.
### Step by Step procedure of the experiment
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream)

Step 2 - Create a base class (Base) with the following class members as public members. a as data members. display() and read() as member function

Step 3 - Create a Derived class (Derived) with the following class members as public members. b as data members. display() and read() as member function

Step 4 - Implement the member functions with the respective code.

Step 5 - Create a main() method.

Step 6 - Creating two objects of Base as obj1.

Step 7 - Creating two objects of Derived as obj2.

Step 8 - Call the member function display() and read() with obj1 and obj2.

Step 9 - return 0 to exit form the program execution.
