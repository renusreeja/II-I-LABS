# Experiment 12(b)
## Aim : Write a C++ Program to illustrate late binding.
### Step by Step procedure of the experiment
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream)

Step 2 - Create a base class (Base) with the following class members as public members. show() as member function

Step 3 - Create a Derived class (Derived) with the following class members as public members. show() as member function

Step 4 - Implement the member functions with the respective code.

Step 5 - Create a main() method.

Step 6 - Create a pointer to Base class as bp.

Step 7 - Allocate the memory to class Derived using new operator.

Step 8 - Call the member function show() with bp.

Step 9 - return 0 to exit form the program execution.
