# Experiment 3
## Aim: Write a C++ program to read the data of N employee and compute Net salary of each employee (DA=52% of Basic and Income Tax (IT) =30% of the gross salary)
### Step by Step Procedure for the Experiment
Step 1 - Include the required header files (iostream).

Step 2 - Create a class Employee with the following members. e_id, name, bs, da, it, net_sal, gross as data memebrs and read(), cal_da(), cal_gross(), cal_it(), cal_netsaal() as member functions.

Step 3 - Implement all the member functions with their respective code.

Step 4 - Create a main() method.

Step 5 - Create an array of class object e with a specific size and 'i' as integer.

Step 6 - Call all the functions through the array of class object from 0 to specific size.

Step 7 - returnn 0 to exit from the program execution.
