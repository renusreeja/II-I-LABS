# Experiment 3
## Aim: Write a C++ program to read the data of N employee and compute Net salary of each employee (DA=52% of Basic and Income Tax (IT) =30% of the gross salary)
### Step by Step Procedure for the Experiment

Step 3 - Implement all the member functions with their respective code.

Step 4 - Create a main() method.

Step 5 - Create an array of class object with a specific size and 'i' as integer.

Step 6 - Call the get_details() method through the array of class object from 0 to specific size.

Step 7 - Call the print_details() method through the array of class object from 0 to specific size.

Step 8 - returnn 0 to exit from the program execution.
